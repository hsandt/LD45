# Wit Fighter

My Ludum Dare 45 entry on the theme "Start with nothing".

It is an adaptation of Monkey Island's "Insult swordfighting", a discipline where characters jousted with each other by throwing insults and comebacks at their opponent. Despite the use of swords, the result of the fight was ultimately decided by how good.

In this game there are no swords, just the insults, and it takes place in an office staircase full of hateful employees. You play a hackathon organizer seeking financial support from his sister, the CEO of the company, who works at the highest floor.

## Terminology

Insults are named "attacks" and comebacks are named "replies". They are both referred to as "quotes" (despite not being actual movie quotes).

## How to play

### Run the game

This game was made with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), so there are different ways to play:
- Download the HTML5 version, or go to the [itch.io page](https://hsandt.itch.io/wit-fighter) (WIP) to play in your browser
- Download one of the release binaries to play directly on Windows, OSX, Linux
- If you own PICO-8, download the .p8 cartridge and run it inside PICO-8

### Controls

The game is played with the keyboard.

- Arrows: quote selection
- Z/C/N (O button in PICO-8): confirm selection, continue dialogue
- X/V/M (X button ins PICO-8): cancel?
- Enter: pause

## USP

As unique sales point compared to Monkey Island:
- Multiple replies can work against a given attack (in Monkey Island, only the opposite is true, and only when including the boss)
- Attacks and replies have a level, which decides how much (mental) damage is dealt to the opponent
- NPCs learn your quotes (WIP)
